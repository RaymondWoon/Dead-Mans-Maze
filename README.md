## 4.1 Art Style

The art style will be a 3D polygon style which offers a timeless art style with colorful theme that makes the game unique and convey a playful feel. The game will use 3D polygon assets by Synty as much as possible to provide a consistent art style throughout the entire game including characters, items, building and the environment. Where a specific asset is unavailable, a custom model with texture will be made to resemble the art style as much as possible.

The player can control the character to move, sprint, jump, crouch and shoot with polygon weapons to match the game's art style. The game will put heavy emphasis on gunplay with impactful shots at every bullet strike and shells ejecting from the gun, coupled with satisfying reload animations.
